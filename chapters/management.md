# Project Management

## Summary and Methodology

A project with multiple complex elements requires careful planning and preparation to be
successful, and avoid wasted time in the future. Whilst generally proceedings went smoothly,
there were definite lessons learned from this project that can and will be applied to future
endeavours. To build the testbed application - the iterative life cycle methodology was employed,
allowing the application to quickly progress in the early stages, and gradually improve throughout
the entire process. This is due to the acceptance that with an iterative lifecycle methodolgy there
will be a lot of rework, particularly at the early stages of the project (Krutchen 2000).
The testbed application was also built making use of version control (Git).

With additions like the alternative frameworks, and the automated data
collection script, making use of Puppeteer and the Devtools Web API - this method was effective,
particularly for a one-person team. (This is where many of the other project management methodologies
struggle to have an impact). With the iterative lifecyle methodology being applied at both a micro and macro level,
the kanban approach was employed to supplement it, utilising the GitHub Projects interface.


## Timeline

Making use of Gantt Chart, and GitHub Projects feature to plan a schedule. Retrospecitvely,
the project should have been planned in greater detail, allowing the Gantt chart to be less
abstracted initially - making definitive goal setting more achievable. Alongside this, the supervisor
meetings were utilised to draw up goals and criteria to have achieved by the next session.
This allowed the project to be split into weekly chunks that were integrated into the continually
evolving Gantt Chart - laying out a clear and concise overall plan for projct completion. Supplementing
the supervisor sessions, an (almost) weekly diary was kept to track project progress, available in
Appendix F.

## Communication

Whilst it took longer than planned to contact the project supervisor - a recognised mistake from
the author, when meetings became a regular occurance, the project began to build steadily
and effectively. The supervision was of pivotol importance in relation to this project, with
a prediction of difficulty progressing effectively during the early stages.

Evidence of the meetings with the supervisor is located in Appendix A.

### Presentation Feedback

After the presentation, the decision was made to change the focus of case study 2. Whilst
partially relevant - the research would have shown that web apps perform better with heavy
processing done on a server, leaving the client with a light load, and that a server could
send a more optimised bundle for a device. Whilst achievable as an experiment - this research
would likely not have shed any new light on the area - therefore the JavaScript frameworks
comparison became the new subject for case study 2. Alongside this, whilst the topic for case
study 2 had changed, the feedback on the justification was still valid - therefore this has
been ammended in section 3.6. In addition to this, Figure \ref{flow_chart}
was created to help the reader visualise the experimentation process.

## Legal, Social and Ethical Implications

### MIT License

All of the technologies being tested in this project are open source, and all licensed under
the MIT license. This is one of the most permissive licenses, and means
that the software created with these licenses can 

Whilst now under the MIT licsense, it is worth noting that React used
to be under the BSD+Patents license. which states the code is copyrighted by
Facebook (the creators of React). If you sue Facebook for patent
infringement, then your patent rights for React are automatically revoked
(Kripalani 2017). The switch to MIT proved in response to the disappointment
and uncertainty from its community (Wolff 2017).
