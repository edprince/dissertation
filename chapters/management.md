# Project Management

## Summary and Methodology

A project with multiple complex elements requires careful planning and preparation to be
successful, and avoid wasted time in the future. Whilst generally proceedings went smoothly,
there were definite lessons learned from this project that can and will be applied to future
endeavours. To build the testbed application - the iterative life cycle methodology was employed,
allowing the application to quickly progress in the early stages, and gradually improve throughout
the entire process. This is due to the acceptance that with an iterative lifecycle methodology there
will be a lot of rework, particularly at the early stages of the project (Krutchen 2000).

With additions like the alternative frameworks, and the automated data
collection script, making use of Puppeteer and the DevTools Web API - this method was effective,
particularly for a one-person team. (This is where many of the other project management methodologies
struggle to have an impact). 
The testbed application was also built making use of version control (Git)
as a way of tracking code - helping progression on the practical elements
of the project.
With the iterative lifecyle methodology being applied at both a micro and macro level,
the kanban approach was employed to supplement it, utilising the GitHub Projects interface.
Combined, these approaches helped the practical elements of the project
to be completed earlier than initially planned - with only minor
tweaks added throughout the later stages of the project.

## Timeline

To create a visual aid for the project timeline, teamgantt.com was used.
This create my initial Gantt chart (Figure \ref{gantt}).
Whilst the Gantt chart did evolve to become less abstracted - retrospecitvely,
the project should have been planned in greater detail from an earlier
stage, making definitive goal setting more achievable. Alongside this, the supervisor
meetings were utilised to define goals and criteria to have achieved by the following session.
This helped to split the project into weekly chunks that were integrated into the continually
evolving Gantt Chart - laying out a clear and concise overall plan for project completion. Supplementing
the supervisor sessions, an (almost) weekly diary was kept to track project progress, available in
Appendix F.

## Communication

Whilst it took longer than planned to contact the project supervisor - a recognised mistake from
the author, when meetings became a regular occurence, the project began to build steadily
and effectively. The supervision was of pivotal importance in relation to this project, with
a prediction of difficulty progressing effectively during the early stages without it.

Evidence of the meetings with the supervisor is located in Appendix A.

### Presentation Feedback

After the presentation, the decision was made to change the focus of case study 2. Whilst
partially relevant - the research would have shown that web apps perform better with heavy
processing done on a server, leaving the client with a light load, and that a server could
send a more optimised bundle for a device. Whilst achievable as an experiment - this research
would likely not have shed any new light on the area - therefore the JavaScript frameworks
comparison became the new subject for case study 2. Alongside this, whilst the topic for case
study 2 had changed, the feedback on the justification was still valid - therefore this has
been amended in section 3.6. In addition to this, Figure \ref{flow_chart}
was created to help the reader visualise the experimentation process.

## Legal, Social and Ethical Implications

### MIT License

All of the technologies being tested in this project are open source, and all licensed under
the MIT license. This is one of the most permissive licenses, and means
that the software created with these licenses can keep source code
private when distributing software that makes use of any of these
technologies. For many commercial companies - this is much more
desirable than using any software licensed under less permissive
licenses, such as the GPL version 2 - which would force them to make their
source code available (GNU 1989).

Whilst now under the MIT license, it is worth noting that React used
to be under the BSD+Patents license. which states the code is copyrighted by
Facebook (the creators of React). If you sue Facebook for patent
infringement, then your patent rights for React are automatically revoked
(Kripalani 2017). The switch to licensing under the MIT license proved to be
in response to the disappointment and uncertainty from its community (Wolff 2017).

### Impact of Better User Experiences in the Developing World

Better web app design encourages growth of users. If developing
countries were to see more web apps were catering for consumption
on the popular lower-powered devices, evidence shows that more
people would adopt devices. Alongside this, it has been shown that
mobile phone adoption has a huge effect on economies. According to
Dahir, in 2015 mobile services generated 6.7% of Africa's GDP, around
$150 billion in economic value (Dahir 2016). With the findings mentioned in the Literature Review - 
faster, more optimised applications are more likely to retain users
than applications that are slow (AppDynamics and University of London 2014).
