# Project Management

## Summary

A project with multiple complex elements requires careful planning and preparation to be
successful, and avoid wasted time in the future. Whilst generally proceedings went smoothly,
there were definite lessons learned from this project that can and will be applied to future
endeavours.


## Timeline

Making use of Gantt Chart, and GitHub Projects feature to plan a schedule. Retrospecitvely,
the project should have been planned in greater detail, allowing the Gantt chart to be less
abstracted - making definitive goal setting more achievable.

## Communication

Regular meetings with supervisor, along with emails. Evidence of each in the appendix.
The meetings started later than they should, which meant that many of the tasks ahead
needed to be condensed into smaller chunks to allow the project to be completed on time.

## Legal, Social and Ethical Implications

Potential for degrading software or devices.
Any danger of associating devices to parts of the world.
