# Project Management

## Summary and Methodology

A project with multiple complex elements requires careful planning and preparation to be
successful, and avoid wasted time in the future. Whilst generally proceedings went smoothly,
there were definite lessons learned from this project that can and will be applied to future
endeavours. To achieve the final result - the iterative life cycle methodology was employed,
allowing the project to get on its feet in the early stages, and gradually improve throughout
the entire process. With additions like the alternative frameworks, and the automated data
collection script, making use of Puppeteer and the Devtools Web API - this method was effective,
particularly for a one-person team. This is where many of the other project management methodologies
struggle to have an impact.

## Timeline

Making use of Gantt Chart, and GitHub Projects feature to plan a schedule. Retrospecitvely,
the project should have been planned in greater detail, allowing the Gantt chart to be less
abstracted - making definitive goal setting more achievable. Alongside this, the supervisor
meetings were utilised to draw up goals and criteria to have achieved by the next session.

## Communication

Whilst it took longer than planned to contact the supervisor - a recognised mistake from
the author, when meetings became a regular occurance, the project began to build steadily
and effectively. 

### Presentation Feedback

After the presentation, the decision was made to change the focus of case study 2. Whilst
partially relevant - the research would have shown that web apps perform better with heavy
processing done on a server, leaving the client with a light load, and that a server could
send a more optimised bundle for a device. Whilst achievable as an experiment - this research
would likely not have shed any new light on the area - therefore the JavaScript frameworks
comparison became the new subject for case study 2.

## Legal, Social and Ethical Implications

Potential for degrading software or devices.
Any danger of associating devices to parts of the world.
