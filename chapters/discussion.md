# Discussion

Talk about service workers as a possible improvement on this research.
Testing in other browsers, and testing across more machines.

Whilst useful data has been recorded in this project, the data could be
sibstantially backed up with more experiments. Critically, testing the
application across real mobile phones would further the claim that the
conclusions were valid in specific relation to the original research question.
Building on this - the experiment could also be carried out on specifically
the most common devices being used in developing countries, with direct
comparisons to performance on new smartphones.

Another useful avenue for testing could be to utilise a more substantial
open source application, for example the Hacker News clone on GitHub at
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0. This would also reinforce
the conclusions being made in this dissertation, with no uncertainty based
on the validity of the testbed application as a source of possible outlying
results.
