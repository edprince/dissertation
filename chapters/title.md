  This paper looks at methods for optimising modern web applications for users with
  low-powered smartphones. The research focuses on front-end optimisations,
  in particular bundlers, and JavaScript user interface frameworks. 
  By analysing a testbed realtime chatting applications, built with
  different frameworks, socket.io and Node.js, it is discovered that
  performance optimisations can be made without sacraficing user or developer 
  experience. This was found using the Google Development Tools to analyse
