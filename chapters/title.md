\begin{abstract}
  This paper looks at methods for optimising modern web applications for users with
  low-powered smartphones. By analysing a testbed application, it is discovered that
  performance optimisations can be made without sacraficing user experience. This was
  found using the Google Development Tools to analyse an app built with React, Node.js,
  Socket.io and Express.js.
