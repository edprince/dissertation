#Introduction

Chapter 4 explores a selection of the relevant existing literature surrounding and 
encapsulating the topic. Due to the subject being in its infancy in relation to most 
areas of Computer Science - there is a distinct lack of relevant literature. 
Network-based optimisations are a popular article subject - but as it bears little need 
in developed countries - less powerful CPU based optimisations are not a hot topic for 
academic research. Whilst the usefulness is definitely questionable in developing 
countries - many developing country populations still use older smartphones, and could 
benefit from more research in this area - ultimately providing better user experiences for global user bases. Additionally - if an application can reduce the required usage of the CPU - it can also reduce the CPU power consumption and required cooling - ultimately increasing battery life, a feature useful anywhere in the world.
The methodology chapter presents the formation and execution of the experiments, and details on how results could be replicated. The experiments are split up into component sections, each identifying a different area for potential optimisation. Each section has a brief summary, a prediction of the expected results upon modification and re-profiling, and the actual results, how the compare, and why they might differ to the predictions. The chapter is concluded with a summary of all of the results, and how they relate to optimisations for low-powered smartphones.
